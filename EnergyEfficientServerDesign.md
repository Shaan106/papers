## Problem Description and Motivation
The paper addresses the environmental impact of AI's exponential growth. As AI applications rapidly expand across industries, there is a super-linear growth in data, model sizes, and infrastructure requirements. This growth creates significant environmental challenges through both operational energy consumption and the manufacturing carbon footprint. The authors argue that understanding and mitigating AI's environmental impact requires a holistic approach, considering the complete lifecycle of AI systems.

## Main Ideas/Approach

### Growth Trends in AI
- Model sizes increased 1000x in recent years
- Training data volumes doubled between 2019-2021
- Infrastructure capacity grew 2.9x for training and 2.5x for inference
- Model parameters increased 20x for recommendation systems

### Development Phases
1. Data Processing: Feature extraction and data preparation
2. Experimentation: Algorithm design and evaluation
3. Training: Production-scale model training
4. Inference: Model deployment and prediction serving

### Carbon Footprint Analysis
- Both operational and embodied carbon must be considered.
- Manufacturing accounts for ~50% of total carbon footprint.
- Infrastructure power capacity roughly splits as:  
  - 10% Experimentation  
  - 20% Training  
  - 70% Inference  
- Training large models can produce emissions equivalent to 242,231 miles of car travel.

### Sustainability Strategies
- Hardware-software co-design for efficiency
- Use of carbon-free energy sources
- Resource-efficient experimentation
- Data efficiency improvements
