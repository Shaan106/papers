## Abstract
*Hardware specialization, in the form of accelerators that provide custom datapath and control for specific algorithms and applications, promises impressive performance and energy advantages compared to traditional architectures. Current research in accelerator analysis relies on RTL-based synthesis flows to produce accurate timing, power, and area estimates. Such techniques not only require significant effort and expertise but are also slow and tedious to use, making large design space exploration infeasible. To overcome this problem, we present Aladdin, a pre-RTL, power-performance accelerator modeling framework and demonstrate its application to system-on-chip (SoC) simulation. Aladdin estimates performance, power, and area of accelerators within 0.9%, 4.9%, and 6.6% with respect to RTL implementations. Integrated with architecture-level core and memory hierarchy simulators, Aladdin provides researchers an approach to model the power and performance of accelerators in an SoC environment.*

## Results

Aladdin is a pre-RTL tool that allows for the exploration of the design space of accelerators. It is able to estimate the performance, power, and area of accelerators within 0.9%, 4.9%, and 6.6% with respect to RTL implementations. This allows for the exploration of the design space of accelerators before the RTL design is complete.

## Notes

There are tools which exist that optimize the power and performance of components such as CPUs and GPUs. However, the development of accelerators is a very manual process and there are no tools to optimize the power and performance of accelerators.

Aladdin is a tool that allows for the exploration of the design space of accelerators. It is a pre-RTL tool, meaning that it is a tool that can be used before the RTL (Register Transfer Level) design of the accelerator is complete. This allows for the exploration of the design space of accelerators before the RTL design is complete.

Very well written paper
