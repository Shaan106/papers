# IBM experiments in soft fails in computer electronics (1978-1994)
J. Ziegler et al. 1996

## Summary

This paper focuses on IBM's experiments in soft errors that occur due to cosmic rays and other radiation sources (ie Polonium contamination). The paper covers the story of the discovery, categorization and mitigation of these errors in IBM's computer systems. The paper focuses mainly on the SER metric - the soft error rate, and shows its evolution over time as technology evolves. They show how smaller and more modern electronics are more susceptible to these errors, especially at higher altitude, which necessitates more in built redundancy for device operation without critical faults

### Strengths

- The paper follows the story of the discovery of these errors in IBM's systems very well, and articulates the logical steps in how discoveries were made well.

- Each study done in the past has its shortcomings well addressed in the paper, and it is clear how the next study was built upon the previous one.

- I also found the abandoned Hawaii detection base quite amusing, and would have liked to hear a bit more about it.

### Weaknesses

- The paper does not delve into the specifics of how these errors are actually mitigated in the hardware. It would have been nice to see some more detail on how these errors are actually detected and corrected.

## Questions

- Was there a critical size of transistor or memory where these errors started to appear? 

- Were these errors present in the initial very large computers of the past?
