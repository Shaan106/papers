## Abstract

*This article outlines a set of plug-in tools running on MATLAB to automatically import, preprocess, and evaluate the quality of electro-encephalography (EEG) data stored using the Brain Imaging Data Structure BIDS-EEG standard. As a proof of concept, we apply several possible data quality metrics to 30 EEG studies (sets of compatible datasets) currently available in BIDS-EEG format on the OpenNeuro.org platform. The bids-matlab-tools plug-in for EEGLAB (sccn.ucsd.edu/EEGLAB) checks for the presence of information needed for analysis, then applies preprocessing pipelines that compute data quality metrics and retain dataset portions (e.g., those channels and time points) that appear suitable for analysis. These and other data measures and visualizations will be made available to the EEG community through a new NEMAR.org web portal now under development to support the use of the OpenNeuro.org data archive by the human electrophysiology research community.*
